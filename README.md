# SpaceEngineers LCD Image Generator
Space Engineers LCD Image Generator made using React

This work is HEAVILY based in [Whips-Image-Converter](https://github.com/Whiplash141/Whips-Image-Converter) from [Whiplash141](https://github.com/Whiplash141). Thanks for the project!!!

I basically just ported everything to react. It works about the same as Whips converter, just drag & drop the image in the page and then click to copy the result. The result should be pasted in LCD Text area.
